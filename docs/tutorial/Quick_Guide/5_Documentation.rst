How a Radii project can be documented for future use:

--------
Saving:
--------

**From Grasshopper:**

- with the save component
  - save everything as a radii file to be used locally
  - save everything to the cloud
- save the control's in a grashopper component

**Viewer:**

Everything that was received by the Viewer can be saved locally through the remote content menu.
It can then be opened again at a later time. 
With this method you could for example save a presentation at its end to explore it further at a later moment.
