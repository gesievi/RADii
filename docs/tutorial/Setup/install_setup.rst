Viewer PC/Mac
_________________

To explore models in Radii you need a viewer, this is a programm that enables you to join a server (we call them channels) and download the models.
Viewers are available for a number of different operating systems such as Windows/Mac, IPhone/Android and Occulus. 
The viewers are generally the same but have some differences, usually due to computing power.
